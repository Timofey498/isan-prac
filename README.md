# Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fiber

## Overview
An experimental study of supercontinuum generation in a photonic crystal fiber **SCG-800 (Newport)** pumped by a femtosecond Ti:sapphire laser was conducted.  
The optical setup included coupling the radiation into the fiber through a microscope objective, followed by three-axis alignment to ensure single-mode propagation.

## Experimental Details
- **Pump wavelength range:** 725–925 nm (step 25 nm)  
- **Input power range:** 100–700 mW (step 100 mW)  
- **Fiber:** SCG-800, photonic crystal type  
- **Spectrometer:** portable unit with integration-time normalization  

## Data Processing
- Normalization with respect to spectrometer integration time  
- Standardization of spectra for cross-comparison  
- Visualization of spectral profiles under varying input parameters  

## Results
- The **broadest and most uniform spectra** were obtained for pump wavelengths near **800 nm**.  
- For **λ > 900 nm**, a pronounced narrow spectral band appeared, whose position depended on input power.
